\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
%context
Documenting API routines counts as a key benefit from applying the Design by Contract (DbC) methodology. 
In this context, DBC's pre- and post-conditions are used as part of the routine's public interface, for establishing call conditions and expected results, respectively, which could be then checked at runtime for detecting invalid calls or non-conforming implementations.
%
% problem
It is well known, however, that programmers, despite this convenience, are resistant to use contracts -- for Java programs, in particular, Javadoc natural text and tags are the dominant medium for documenting APIs. 
As a result, verification assistance is unavailable.
%
% solution
In this paper, we report results from empirical studies on integrating contract expressions into Javadoc comments used as external API documentation. 
For this purpose, we designed a small tag-based extension to Javadoc to express pre- and post-conditions among other standard tags.
%
%studies
The studies consisted in (1) evaluating understandability of contract expressions within API Javadoc, either for API developers or API users, by means of a experimental study and a follow-up survey, and (2) assessing its efficacy with a case study in which we manually formalized English contracts from open source Java systems into contract expressions, then checking conformance in runtime.    
%
%results
Both quantitative and qualitative data show no significant difference between Javadoc English text and contract expressions, regarding either correctness of performed tasks or contract readability. 
Also, a straightforward translation of open source APIs to contract expressions was able to find a number of conformance problems between API contracts and implementation, embodying evidence on the usefulness of contract expressions for uncovering errors regarding the relationship between documentation and actual behaviour.
%
%consequences
These results are promising to research the adoption of contract languages for API documentation.
\end{abstract}

%(2) an empirical study
%with 24 programmers using three different documenting approaches, including
%\contractjdoc{}, whose results did not significantly differ, and (3) we surveyed 142 Java programmers regarding \contractjdoc{}'s
%readability in contrast to other two approaches (Javadoc and JML), in which
%results did not significantly differ for \contractjdoc{} and Javadoc, which is
%promising, since contracts are regarded as hard to read.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Doc comments counts as best practice for API documentation, but does not compel
programmers to provide a precise or complete behaviour of a routine.
%
This is, on the other hand, the very essence of contracts, but programmers are resistant to use contracts in their modules.
%, as it does not meet the need of usual readers, such as third-party library users.
%
In this scenario, we propose
% a Javadoc-like language for integrating contracts,
an approach for documenting code by means of contracts into brackets associated
with tag comments, called \contractjdoc{}, and apply the approach to the Java context.
%In support of the research contributions, 
This paper presents three empirical studies:
(1) we manually applied \contractjdoc{} to two real Javadoc-rich open source
systems and four toy projects, in which we detected inconsistencies between
the existing Javadoc and the corresponding source code; (2) an empirical study
with 24 programmers using three different documenting approaches, including
\contractjdoc{}, whose results did not significantly differ, and (3) we surveyed 142 Java programmers regarding \contractjdoc{}'s
readability in contrast to other two approaches (Javadoc and JML), in which
results did not significantly differ for \contractjdoc{} and Javadoc, which is
promising, since contracts are regarded as hard to read.
% conclusions?
Therefore, \contractjdoc{} is an approach that can foster contracts adoption,
helping to improve software quality.
